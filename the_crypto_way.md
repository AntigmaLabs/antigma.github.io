# The Crypto Way
We will do it the crypto way, especially now when it is associated with scams, pump-and-dump schemes, and get-rich-quick thirst traps. Even some respected OGs have started to view it as "Glorified Casinos", thinking in terms of "Regulation Arbitrage". Maybe they lost their faith after FTX and SVB, and who can blame them? But we remember.

We remember the practical idealists (Satoshis) who started Bitcoin with a grand vision but assumed the worst. A peer-to-peer payment network that is NOT built with "love" or wishy-washy smoke-and-mirrors, but with the ethos of "don't trust, verify" and the weight of the longest history.

We remember the crazy ones (Vitaliks) who wanted to build a world computer with Ethereum. People who didn't even speak each other's languages flew all over the world to meet, pouring countless money and energy into someone they barely knew in a heartbeat just because they shared the same vision and were inspired by their enthusiasm.

We remember the Degens who embraced stupidity and cringeness, testing innovative protocols with utmost forgiveness, forming bonds and communities across cultures and races over funny JPEGs, and laughing off horrendous losses that would shake even the most seasoned investors. After all, who are we to pretend that we know better, to know the difference between stupidity and bravery, to see cringeness as anything but daring to think differently? "Stay hungry, stay foolish," they say, and this shall be the new ethos for our Degens, the Decentralized Generation.

We remember because we were there, front-row seat, witnessing the miracle made by the power of community, the pure bliss of faith, and the raw energy of moving-fast-and-breaking-things, and how the world was changed in its wake.

So yes, we will do it the crypto way. Because we know every wave comes with bubbles and foam, and we have our eyes on the right target; that the story of Creator, Psychopath, Fanatic, and Mob will keep playing out over and over again, and we know what role we are committed to play, for there is nothing more divine than the joy of creating something valuable. From history and experience, we know we are not alone, and we will not be alone.

To openness and clarity!
